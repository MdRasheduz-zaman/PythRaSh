# Q1  
I have many files inside a folder. I want to move them into to sub-folders named `f1` and `f2` (I made them using `mkdir -p f1 f2`). How to do that?  
This is the way:  
  
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
i=0
for file in $(ls *.fastq.gz | sort -V); do
  if [ $i -le 400 ]; then
    mv "$file" f1/
  else
    mv "$file" f2/
  fi
  i=$((i + 1))
done
```
Here, I am sending files having 0-400 in there name to `f1` folder and remaining ones to `f2`. You just need to use your file naming pattern, and you are all set.  

**How to execute/run this file now?**  
Run these:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
chmod +x move_files.sh
./move_files.sh
```
`chmod +x` is making the file executable. Then we are running it using `./move_files.sh`.
