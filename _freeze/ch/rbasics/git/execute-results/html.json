Regular practice will be easier in this way.\n\n-   `git` and `GitHub` configuration is a bit tedious process (to make it secure for us though), but we are supposed to do it one time only. We don't need to do it again and again.\n\n-   Another important aspect is we are learning \"how to follow instructions\".\n\n-   Many personal things in programming are in generic terms. We have to replace them accordingly. For example, `your_name@gmail.com`, `your_user_name`, `your_password`, `path/to/your/file`,`your meaningful message` etc.\n\n-   Learning to ask questions.\n\n-   The standard workflow to work with a GitHub repository follows these few steps:\n\n1.  Go to your GitHub account → Find the `+` sign and click on it → Click on `New Repository`.\n2.  Clone it in your computer (inside your preferred folder) running `git clone git@github.com:yourusername/test1.git`. Don't forget to replace `git@github.com:yourusername/test1.git` with the SSH link you copied for your repo.\n3.  Make changes in your folder by adding or creating files/folders. You can optionally check status of your folder running `git status`.\n4.  Stage/prepare/add them all to git running `git add .`.\\\n5.  Commit/decorate it with a meaningful message running `git commit -m \"your meaningful message\"`.\n6.  Now push it to your remote (GitHub) repo running `git push origin main`.\n\n-   We are recognizing code chunks in the document/page. Single line, multi-line code, and how to run them (run codes from the code chunks, even if I don't explicitly say **Run**). Did you catch that running a code means writing (or copy-pasting) and pressing \"Enter\"/\"Return\" key on keyboard? Also, run multi-line code line by line, meaning next line after finishing the previous one running.\n\n-   Getting used to different vocabulary related to Computer and programming.\n\n-   We learned navigating the file system from the bash/terminal.\n\n# Prelude\n\nWell, why `git`and `command line` at the very beginning? I want you to be able to interact with me for all the lessons, take part in the GitHub discussion and make you competent with basic git tasks (`push`and `pull`). You actually need 4-5 lines of code to push and pull. You will associate bash alternatives to Windows' Graphical User Interphase (GUI, which is mouse clicking). Just get used to these stuffs. You will get the sense of accomplishment everyday. You know what, people get demotivated just because they don't get the sense of accomplishment. Smaller task completion helps to pile up \"done\" things. I am here holding your hands. Don't afraid to tinker and ponder around. You can always delete the problematic folder(s).\n\nYou can push the codes/scripts from the classes or your own practice codes. You will FEEL better and stronger after a bit of hustling!\n\n***`GET ENGAGED!`***\n\n# Intro\n\nGitHub is just like Google Drive, Dropbox or similar where you can `upload` (or `push`) files and folders of your project/package. What is special about the GitHub repositories then? Well, they are tracked for changes. How so? Well, `git` does that. `git` is the version control system (or tool) to track changes you make in a specific directory/repository (directory means folder as well). So you can have snapshot of your changes and fall back and forth if needed.\n\n**Imagine this situation:** You made a working version of whatever you are doing/making. But then you were trying to polish it more. And alas, your so-called polishing is messing you up! You don't know what is wrong! You closed the file many times and you can't just `undo` and `redo` things. What would you do now except cursing (or other similar behavior of frustration)? Here comes `git` in your rescue. It kept the snapshot of your previous working version(s) in GitHub (if pushed) and you can easily fall back and forth (`clone`/`download`/`pull` it in your machine again). Maybe, the terms \"upload\" and \"download\" make a bit more sense, rather than `push` and `pull`/`clone`! But you got the (equivalent) idea, right?\n\n# Set git and GitHub\n\n## Install Git\n\n### For Windows\n\n-   **Download:** Download `Git` from <https://git-scm.com/download/win>\n-   **Install:** Now install, accept the default settings while installing\n-   **Open git bash:** After installation, open `Git Bash` (not cmd/PowerShell). Find it and open by double clicking. Just keep it open, nothing else. We will return to this a bit later.\n\n### For MacOS\n\nIt should already be there. Open your terminal/shell now (Press `\"command\"` + `\"space\"` buttons together and write \"terminal\". Choose the terminal). Then run:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ngit --version\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf Git isn’t installed, macOS will prompt you to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. Click \"Install\" and you are done. But find the recommended below. Just run these two commands to keep your directory/repo clean.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\necho .DS_Store >> ~/.gitignore_global\ngit config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global\n```\n:::\n\n\nMacOS makes `.DS_Store` which is not really needed for any projects (this is just an internal thingy for MacOS). But to make it work, we should have chosen the option for a gitignore file while opening the GitHub repository. We will know more about it later. Don't worry. We are adding it to gitignore and telling git to ignore it for file tracking.\n\n### For Ubuntu/Debian\n\nOpen your terminal (Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`.) and run these two commands one after another:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install git\n```\n:::\n\n\nProvide your password if prompted. You are all set!\n\n## Create a GitHub Account\n\n-   Now go to <https://github.com> → Sign up with your email\n-   Choose a username and password. Make the username easy to remember (for example, with your names, maybe), password should be as difficult as possible.\n\nHint, it can be different than your email password. Use combination of capital and small letters, numbers and special characters like \"@\", \"!\", \"?\", etc.\n\n-   Verify email (with the OTP) and you are set.\n\n## Set Up Git (for the first time only)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ngit config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\ngit config --global user.email \"your_email@example.com\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\n## Info!\n\nIt is a multi-line code chunk (2 lines). Run the first one first, then the second one.\n:::\n\n::: callout-warning\n## Stop!\n\nHere, `Your Name` and `your_email@example.com` means your user name (the one you set up just a bit ago. You don't remember? Explore your GitHub account, you will see it there.) and the email address you used for GitHub. Use them correctly. Space, punctuation marks, capital or small letters should exactly match (Don't be a \"Murad Takla\").\n:::\n\nYou can check your config:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ngit config --global --list\n```\n:::\n\n\nIsn't it showing things correctly? It should!\n\n## Generate SSH Key and Connect to GitHub\n\n**Recommended, need to do only once**\n\n::: callout-warning\n## Stop!\n\nThis step is creating a private and public key for you to identify that it is really you who is interacting (pushing, pulling, cloning for example) with the GitHub account later. We only upload the public key to GitHub, but never the private key. That is exclusively for yourself. Never share it with anybody.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"you@example.com\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Read and just press Enter for all the prompts**\n\n::: callout-warning\n## Stop!\n\nDid you replace `you@example.com` with yours? If not, do it again replacing it with correct email address for your GitHub account.\n:::\n\n::: callout-warning\n## Stop!\n\nDid you press Enter or return key multiple times or just kept staring at the screen? Read the messages on your screen to understand, and keep pressing Enter.\n:::\n\n## Add SSH Key to GitHub\n\nNow, we are going to add the public key to GitHub. But do we know it? Get it this way:\n\n1.  Run:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ncat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub\n```\n:::\n\n\n2.  Copy the output: Be careful here. Just copy the output. No extra space after your email address (i.e. till `.com`).\n\n::: callout-warning\n## Stop!\n\nDid you copied it correctly? Check again, maybe.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## How is your key?\n\nIt has 3 fields separated with 2 spaces. Did you notice that?\n:::\n\n3.  Go to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH Key\n\n**Title:** Whatever you want (but keep it simple, like `my ssh key`) **Paste the key** you copied and save it by clicking on `Add SSH key`. You are done.\n\n::: callout-warning\n## Stop!\n\nDid you copy-pasted it correctly and is the key visible if you check under `SSH and GPG keys` now? It shows only the second field of your key though. If not, it is not done correctly. Work around!\n:::\n\n4.  Test it:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nssh -T git@github.com\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\n## How is it?\n\nHi `Your_user_name`! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.\n:::\n\nIt is totally fine, ignore the warning.\n\nSetting and configuration is done. Voila!\n\n# Basic Git Workflow (Local + GitHub)\n\n### Create a New Repository on GitHub\n\n1.  Go to your GitHub account Find the `+` sign and click on it → Click on `New Repository`. Or there is another way. Find it.\n2.  Name it (e.g., test1).\n3.  Don’t initialize with README (we’ll do it ourselves). You can decide to add a `.gitignore` template from the drop-down as well. But don't do it now.\n4.  Keep it public (as the default setting).\n5.  Save it by clicking on `Create repository`.\n\n### Clone It to Your Computer Now:\n\nSo, the repository (basically a folder in GitHub) is in GitHub server. It is not in your machine. Let's copy it exactly how it is in our computer.\n\n-   At first, go to correct location you want to be in. For example, let's say, you want to be inside the `Downloads` folder. Run this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ncd Downloads\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\n## Information\n\nIt works because you are inside the home/root directory (denoted as `~`) when you just open the terminal or git bash.\n:::\n\nWell, If you want to be inside the `Desktop` or `Documents` folder, you could run `cd Desktop` or `cd Documents` instead of the one for `Downloads`. You got the idea for the navigation, right? Just use the correct folder name. Now, go to your GitHub repo. Click on `<>Code` and select `SSH` (or find the SSH link of your repo). Copy the link from there. Use/replace the link in the code below:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ngit clone git@github.com:yourusername/test1.git\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-warning\n## Warning\n\nDid you replace the `git@github.com:yourusername/test1.git` with your copied ssh link?\n:::\n\nSo, you are copying/cloning your empty repository you just have created to your laptop/machine. Good job! Ignore the warning from `git`. The warning is ok, right?\n\n### Add a new `README.md` file\n\nLet's add a new README.md file to our empty repo now. Poeple add basic information about the repo in this file. But it is something simple for us for now. Let's proceed!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ncd test1 \necho \"# Hello GitHub\" > README.md\nls\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\n## Information\n\nSo, it is a new file we created, right? It is on our computer, but not in our remote (GitHub) repository. So, let's proceed to upload/`push` it to our GitHub repo named `test1`. It won't go to other repo. Think about the logic. Why should it go to other repo/folder, right?\n:::\n\n::: callout-note\n## Diversion\n\n`echo \"# Hello GitHub\"` actually prints `# Hello GitHub` on the terminal/git bash (you can check/run by copy-pasting only this part). The `>` operator is sending `# Hello GitHub` to the file named `README.md`. We did not need to create this file from before. See the power of `echo`, `>` together.\n:::\n\n### Track and Commit Changes\n\nWe said `git` is a tracking tool (version control system). So, let's see how it tracked our `test1` folder.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ngit status\n```\n:::\n\n\nIsn't it showing that our `README.md` file is untracked (in red color)?\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\nIt shows the status of the files and folders. You see the untracked files here. Untracked files mean the ones those are different than your GitHub repo. If you add something more in any of your file in this folder -- even an extra space, it would be a change of the file and it would be stated as \"untracked\".\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ngit add README.md\n```\n:::\n\n\nIt stages/prepares the untracked files to be added.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ngit commit -m \"Add README\"\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou add a meaningful commit message for yourself to remind you what you did in this step (a decoration). Make it meaningful. But all these steps are still on your local machine. You have prepared (by using `git add`) and decorated (by using `git commit -m`) your file(s). You are just one step away to `push` it to your remote repo. Just run the command below, and feel like a soft-dev!\n\n### Push to GitHub\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ngit push origin main\n```\n:::\n\n\nGo to your GitHub repo to see the changes. Refresh your browser, maybe.\n\n::: callout-note\n`git status` is not a compulsory thing to do/run, but the other 3 downstream commands are. In summary, you should always run these 3 commands to push something:\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ngit add README.md    # Stage the specific file named README.md\ngit commit -m \"Add README\" #you added a meaningful message for yourself\ngit push origin main #push it now to main branch\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\n## What are the things with `#` sign?\n\nThose are comments to tell you about the commands task (or anything). One just need to write a `#` sign to make it a comment in R.\n:::\n\nWell, if you have added or created many files and folders inside this `test1` folder (in whatever way), you should run:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ngit add .\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `.` means **\"everything\"** inside the current folder/directory. Well, you could run it all the time instead of mentioning specific file name (i.e. `README.md`) earlier.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Note\n\nYou can add and push as many files as you want. Just create/modify them inside the correct folder/directory and instead of `git add README.md`, use `git add .` when you think you're done modifying. The dot here means all the files/folders. Then you could follow the next steps as usual. So, you could do:\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"a meaningful message for you\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-important\nDid you replace `\"a meaningful message for you\"` to a real meaningful one for you?\n:::\n\nCheck your GitHub repo now! Refresh, maybe!\n\n*You are feeling like a PRO, no?*\n\nLet's practice some more Linux navigation. See a toy folder structure below:\n\n``` text\n~/\n├── Desktop/\n│   ├── project_overview.pdf\n│   └── meeting_notes.txt\n├── Documents/\n│   ├── resume.docx\n│   ├── thesis/\n│   │   ├── chapter1.md\n│   │   └── references.bib\n│   └── tax_2024.xlsx\n└── Downloads/\n    ├── folder1/\n    │   ├── file1.txt\n    │   ├── file2.txt\n    │   └── notes.md\n    ├── folder2/\n    │   ├── data.csv\n    │   ├── report.docx\n    │   └── image.png\n    └── folder3/\n        ├── script.sh\n        ├── config.json\n        └── README.md\n```\n\n::: callout-important\nIf you had your git bash opened from before, close it and reopen it. Notice that there is no folder names after `~` sign in your git bash.\n:::\n\nIn real life, you have many more things like `Pictures`, `Video`, `Music` and others under `~`, right? That's why this one is a toy example.\n\nSo, `Downloads` is inside our `~` directory. We are inside our `~` directory when we open the git bash or terminal for the first time.\n\n::: callout-important\n`HOME`or `root` directory is shown as `~` in your computer. Notice the things in different color in your terminal or git bash where you write commands.\n:::\n\nCheck your location (current working directory) by running:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\npwd\n```\n:::\n\n\n`pwd` means \"print working directory\". It means print one's current location in the file system. Then we should try to see which files are inside this folder, right? Run:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nls\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\n`ls` means list everything at that location/folder. According to the picture, we can go to `Downloads` or `Documents` or `Desktop` folder from `~` (it is also called `root`. Isn't the folder structure looks like a upside-down tree? That's why it is the `root`).\n\nLet's say we are focusing on the `Downloads` folder now. Let's go inside `Downloads`. Wait a moment. How would you do that in Windows? You would see `Downloads` now and would double click on it, right (open your file explorer from Windows to see things while reading and running commands to associate better)? But there is no double click in a git bash or terminal. `cd` does it for us. Do you see what is equivalent to that double click? Do you see what is equivalent to seeing the file in Windows and folder structure in the git bash or terminal? It's not so difficult. Think......\n\nOk, follow me exactly now, run these commands:\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ncd Downloads\nmkdir -p folder1 folder2 folder3\nls\n```\n:::\n\n\nI assume you have many files and folders inside `Downloads`. But you should see `folder1`, `folder2`, `folder3` among others now. Don't worry. Just run it. We are using `-p` flag/parameter with `mkdir` command. It says `mkdir` to make the directories, but if the folder(s) exist, it won't make any changes there. So, your files and folders are safe.\n\nLet's navigate out of `Downloads` now and list everything inside `Downloads` in another way.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ncd ..\nls Downloads\n```\n:::\n\n\nDid you notice that I used the folder name `Downloads` after `ls` command now? Well, where are we? Inside the root directory (`~`), right? Since we are at our root directory, if we run only `ls`, it will list everything inside the root (`~`) directory. Did we wanted that? So, we have to write the folder name/path and `Downloads` is just a step forward from `~`. That's why we used `ls Downloads` to list everything inside the `Downloads` folder. We could go inside `Downloads` folder first and then run `ls` only. We would achieve the same thing (try it if you want and come back to the `root` directory again).\n\n`Downloads` is just one-step ahead from our root, do you catch this logic? If you wanted to list everything inside the `folder3` folder, you could run `ls Downloads/folder3` from the `~` directory. Do you see its logic? If not, think about this:\n\n-   How far is your father's generation from your grandfather's?\n-   How far behind is your grandfather's generation compared to your father's?\n-   How far is your generation from your grandfather's?\n-   How far is your generation from your father's?\n-   How far behind is your father's generation from yours?\n-   How far behind is your grandfather's generation from yours?\n-   Isn't the generation/level of your father, aunt(s) and uncle(s) the same? What about yours, your siblings or cousins?\n\nThink of a family tree, computer filesystem is having exactly the same logic. Try to associate (Maybe draw the toy example from above horizontally, it will help to see things which belong to the same level).\n\nIn our toy example above, `folder1`, `folder2`, `folder3` are on the same level/generation (they are children of `Downloads`, and `Downloads` is their parent). Similarly, `Downloads`, `Documents` and `Desktop` are on the same level (children of `~`, so they are siblings). Makes sense?\n\nDo you see how powerful this simple navigation logic is? You can list (using `ls` command) way too far (folder inside folder inside folder inside folder .......\\[or folder outside folder outside folder outside folder ......\\]) from where you are.\n\n**Optional:** Maybe search for `absolute path` and `relative path`, and read a bit.\n\nLet's go inside `Downloads` now.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ncd Downloads\nls\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n`ls` is equivalent of seeing things inside a folder in Windows. Did you catch that?\n:::\n\n`ls` shows `folder1`, `folder2`, `folder3` among many other things, right?\n\n**Q.** How to go inside, let's say, `folder2` now, and make a file named `data.csv` file? Well, since you are already inside `Downloads`, you need to go one step forward to go inside of it and create the (empty) file. Run one after another:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ncd folder2\ntouch data.csv\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Do you see what `touch` is doing?**\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\nWell, `touch` is creating the file (named `data.csv`). Run `ls` to see who else is the resident there. As expected, no?\n:::\n\n*Q.* How to come out of `folder2` to `Downloads` again?\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\nThink backward now, see the picture for the folder structure to get visual help. You need to go one step behind, right? So? How to go backwards?\n:::\n\nRun this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ncd ..\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Could you relate what `..` is meaning here?**\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\nWell, one step/folder backward, right?\n:::\n\n::: callout-note\nAhha.... Wondering why do we have `/` after the folder names? Well, that is the way to denote a folder. We could use `ls Downloads/`, but we dropped the `/` since we are not denoting any more folder after `Downloads`. If you want to see things inside `folder3`, we should have use `ls Downloads/folder3` or `ls Downloads/folder3/` from the `~` directory, we could not do it like `ls Downloadsfolder3` or `ls Downloadsfolder3/`. Now it is looking for `Downloadsfolder3` folder which is not there in your computer. You will get error stating `cd: no such file or directory:`.\n\n**Another point:** Did you notice that `ls Downloads/folder3` is just listing everything inside `Downloads/folder3` on the fly, we are not really changing our physical location there, we are still in `~`. To go inside `folder3`, we should use `cd Downloads/folder3`. Caught this correctly? Ponder....\n:::\n\n# Homeworks\n\n1.  Go inside `folder1`, `folder2`, `folder3` folders one after another and create the empty files as you see in the picture (with exact names). If you can do it, you are almost a PRO in Linux/command line.\n\n2.  Now, remove all the folders running this command below:\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.bash .cell-code}\n    rm -r folder1 folder2 folder3\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n    Here, `rm` means \"remove\" and `-r` means \"recursively\". So, delete the 3 mentioned directories recursively. It needs to recurse since the folders are not empty (have files, although empty for us. But they can have contents as well). Deleting/just running the command is your task. Did it work?\n\n3.  Make all the folders and files as it is shown in the toy file structure again. Don't delete this time. Keep them.\n\n4.  Navigate to `Downloads` again. Stay there. Next task is coming.\n\n5.  Go to your GitHub account and make a repository named `hw_repo1`. **Clone** it inside your `Downloads` folder (navigate to this folder correctly after cloning). Add something (files, folder, whatever) in this folder (`hw_repo1`) and push following the standard workflow. Make as many changes and pushes you like.\n\n6.  Go to your GitHub account again and make a repository named `hw_repo2`. **Clone** it inside your `Downloads` folder (you know how to be inside `Downloads`, right?) again (go inside the `hw_repo2` folder correctly after cloning, you know how). Add something (files, folder, whatever) in this folder (`hw_repo2`) again and push following the standard workflow. Make as many changes and pushes you like.\n\n7.  You learned these bash commands today:\n\n-   `pwd`\n-   `ls`\n-   `cat`\n-   `echo`\n-   `mkdir`\n-   `cd`\n-   `rm`\n-   `touch`\\\n    Can you relate them with Windows alternatives? I am giving a hint for `touch`. `touch` is the alternative of naming a new file while creating in Windows. Windows is doing it visually to help us (using different tools though, for example, Microsoft Words for `.docx` files. You can't name a file like `file_name.jpeg` using Microsoft Words, though. Right? You need some other tools for that image file naming (`.jpeg`). But bash or terminal has no apparent limit). Think of the other commands now. Can you make a mind map of which command comes before or after which one if you are navigating your folders and creating some empty CSV files and inserting content in those files? For example, **a shuffled list of the alphabets** becomes **A → B → C → D → E → ..... → Z** if we organize them, right? Or a map of **Father, Son, Grandson, Me, My_Siblings, Grandma** will be **Grandma → Father → Son → Me + My_Siblings → Grandson** if we think of generations, right? Try to make one for those commands and add it in a file inside one of your `hw_repo*`. `echo` it in a file, make a .doc, .ppt, .png/jpeg/jpg or .txt file or whatever. I don't mind, I just want to see that you got the idea. GitHub also doesn't care what you are pushing to it (it is just a storage with special functionality to track files -- well, some more though, we will know later). Let's see. If you need help, don't hesitate to reach out! There is no shame in asking for help while learning.\n\n8.  Optional: Navigate your other folders as well. Catch the logic of navigation. Also, can you make a list of words I used alternatively (back and forth) and maybe add them in one of your homework repo again? For example, folder, repo, and directory are basically the same thing; similarly, `HOME`, `root` and `~` are the same.\n\n9.  Share your repos with me (**email me by Friday 10PM BD Time**). I need time to check, right? Please, help me here....\n\n# Final Thought\n\nYou might not know how powerful you are getting! But trust me, you are too strong.......\n\n# Advance Tasks\n\n## What if your cloned repo is out of date (new changes happened)?\nRun this to pull the up to date repo.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ngit pull origin main\n```\n:::\n\n(Use `master` if that's your primary branch name.)  \n\nGit will then download any new commits and files from GitHub and integrate them into your local branch. If there are no new changes, it will simply tell you \"Already up to date.\"\n\n**Important:** It's a good habit to `git pull` before you start working on a project each day, or before you begin a new set of changes, to ensure you're always working with the most current version. This helps avoid potential merge conflicts later on.\n\n## How to make changes directly on GitHub and then pull them\n\n**N.B. After this discussion, we'll get into the exciting world of branches and collaboration!**\n\n**Do these**  \n1. Navigate to your repository on `GitHub.com`\n2. Edit the file  \n3. Commit the changes  \n4. Pull the changes to your local machine  \n\n- Open your terminal or Git Bash.\n- Navigate to your local repository folder using `cd your-repo-name`.\n\nRun the git pull command:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ngit pull origin main\n```\n:::\n\n(Again, use `master` if that's your primary branch name.) \n\n## Collaborating with Others: Branches and Pull Requests\n\nNow for some really powerful stuff! So far, we've been working on a single line of development (the `main` or `master` branch). But what if you're working with a team, or you want to experiment with new features without breaking the main, working version of your project? This is where branches come in.\n\n### 1. Understanding Branches\n\nThink of a branch as an independent line of development. When you create a branch, you're essentially making a copy of your project at a specific point in time. You can then make changes on this new branch without affecting the original (`main`) branch.\n\n- `main` (or `master`) branch: This is typically considered the stable, production-ready version of your project.\n- Feature branches: You create these for new features, bug fixes, or experiments. You work on them in isolation.\nOnce you're done with your work on a feature branch and it's stable, you can merge it back into the `main` branch.\n\n**Why use branches?**\n\n- Isolation: Work on new features without impacting the stable code.\n- Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on different features simultaneously without stepping on each others toes.\n- Experimentation: Try out new ideas without fear of breaking the main project.\n\n### 2. Creating and Switching Branches Locally\n\nLet's practice creating a new branch.\n\n**Scenario:** You want to add a new \"Contact Us\" page to your well set website (code), but you don't want to touch the live code until it's ready.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Ensure you're on the main branch and up to date:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ngit checkout main\ngit pull origin main\n```\n:::\n\n`git checkout main` ensures you're on the `main` branch. `git pull` ensures your `main` branch has all the latest changes from GitHub.\n\n2. Create a new branch:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ngit branch feature/contact-page\n```\n:::\n\nIt's common to name branches descriptively, often starting with `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`, etc. Name them meaningfully as you need them for.\n\nThis command creates the branch but doesn't switch you to it yet.\n\n3. Switch to your new branch:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ngit checkout feature/contact-page\n```\n:::\n\nYou'll see a message like \"Switched to branch 'feature/contact-page'\".\n\n**Pro Tip:** You can combine steps 2 and 3 into one command:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ngit checkout -b feature/contact-page\n```\n:::\n\n4. Verify your current branch:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ngit branch\n```\n:::\n\nThe branch you're currently on will have an asterisk (*) next to its name.\n\nNow you are on your `feature/contact-page` branch. Any changes you make, commit, and push will be on this branch, completely separate from `main`.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ngit status\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"created contatc.txt file in the feature branch\"\ngit push origin feature/contact-page\n```\n:::\n\nOnce you've finished your work on a branch and thoroughly tested it, the next step is to merge it back into the `main` branch.\n\n### 3. Merging a Branch (Bringing Your Changes Back)\nMerging is the process of integrating the changes from one branch (like your `feature/contact-page` branch) into another branch (typically `main`).\n\n**Scenario:** You've added your \"Contact Us\" page, it's working perfectly, and you're ready to make it part of the main website (main branch).\n\nSteps:  \n1. Ensure you're on the `main` branch and up to date:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ngit checkout main\ngit pull origin main\n```\n:::\n\nThis is crucial! You want to merge your changes into the latest version of `main`.\n\n2. Merge your feature branch into `main`:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ngit merge feature/contact-page\n```\n:::\n\nThis command tells Git to take all the changes from the `feature/contact-page` branch and apply them to the `main` branch.\n\n**Automatic Merging:** If Git can figure out how to combine the changes without any conflicts, it will do so automatically. You might see a message like \"Successfully merged.\"\n\n**Merge Conflicts:** Sometimes, if both branches have changed the same lines in the same file, Git won't know how to proceed. This results in a merge conflict. We'll cover how to resolve these in a moment.\n\n3. (If the merge was successful) Push the merged `main` branch to GitHub:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ngit push origin main\n```\n:::\n\nThis uploads the merged changes to the remote `main` branch on GitHub.\n\n### 4. Deleting the Feature Branch (Optional but Recommended)\nDelete the branch locally:\nFirst, ensure you're **not** on the branch you want to delete. Switch back to `main`:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ngit checkout main\n```\n:::\n\nThen, delete the local branch:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ngit branch -d feature/contact-page\n```\n:::\n\n- The `-d` flag is for \"delete.\" Git will prevent deletion if the branch has unmerged changes.\n- If you really want to delete a branch with unmerged changes, for whatever reason, (use with caution!), you can use the force delete flag: `git branch -D feature/contact-page` (capital D).\n\nDealing with Merge Conflicts\nMerge conflicts happen when Git can't automatically reconcile changes between branches. It's not a disaster! It just means you need to manually tell Git how to combine the changes.\n\n**Scenario:** You and a collaborator both edited the same section of a file on different branches.\n\nWhat you'll see:\n\n- Git will add special markers to the conflicting file, showing the changes from both branches. It will look something like this:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\n<<<<<<< HEAD\n// Your changes on the main branch\n=======\n// Your collaborator's changes on the feature branch\n>>>>>>> feature/contact-page\n```\n:::\n\n- `<<<<<<< HEAD`: Marks the beginning of the changes on your current branch (main).\n- `=======`: Separates your changes from the changes on the other branch.\n- `>>>>>>> feature/contact-page`: Marks the end of the changes on the `feature/contact-page` branch.\n\n**How to resolve a conflict:**\n\n1. Open the conflicting file in a text editor: You'll see the conflict markers.\n\n2. Manually edit the file: Decide how you want to combine the changes. You might:\n\n  - Keep only your changes.\n  - Keep only the other branch's changes.\n  - Combine parts of both.\n  - Rewrite the section entirely.\n  - Remove the conflict markers: Delete the `<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>> feature/contact-page` lines.\n\n3. Save the file.\n\n4. Stage the resolved file:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ngit add your-conflicting-file.txt\n```\n:::\n\n\n5. Commit the merge:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ngit commit -m \"Resolve merge conflict in your-conflicting-file.txt\"\n```\n:::\n\n6. Push the merged branch:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ngit push origin main\n```\n:::\n\nNow the conflict is resolved, and your changes are safely merged!\n\n### 5. Pull Requests (PRs): The Heart of Collaboration\n\nWhile you can merge branches locally, in a collaborative environment, the most common way to integrate changes is through a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub. A Pull Request is essentially a formal proposal to merge your changes from a feature branch into another branch (usually `main`).\n\n**Why use Pull Requests?**\n\n- Code Review: It allows other team members to review your code, provide feedback, and suggest improvements before the changes are merged into the main codebase. This catches bugs and ensures code quality.\n- Discussion: PRs provide a dedicated space for discussion about the changes.\n- Automated Checks: GitHub can be configured to run automated tests or checks on PRs, ensuring the new code doesn't break existing functionality.\n- Record Keeping: PRs create a clear history of how and why changes were integrated.\n\n**Scenario:** You've completed your tasks for `feature/contact-page` and pushed it to GitHub. Now you want your team to review it and eventually merge it into main.\n\nSteps to create a Pull Request:  \n1. At first, pull the repo to your local machine and make changes:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ngit clone git@github.com:yourusername/repoLink.git\ngit checkout main\ngit checkout -b feature/contact-page\n#you can name your branch with something else depending on your task \n#Now make changes (files) or do whatever you want to do with coding\n#Then push the changes\ngit status\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"My contribution\"\ngit push origin feature/contact-page\n```\n:::\n\nBefore you can create a PR, your branch needs to exist on GitHub. If you just created it locally and committed changes, you'll need to push it up. \n\nThe first time you push a new branch, Git might give you a hint like:\n`git push --set-upstream origin feature/contact-page`\nJust copy and paste that command if you see it.  \n2. Go to your repository on `GitHub.com`:\nOnce your branch is pushed, GitHub will often display a banner at the top of your repository page, suggesting you **\"Compare & pull request\"** for your newly pushed branch. If not, click on the **\"Pull requests\"** tab.  \n3. Click **\"New pull request\"**:\nIf the banner isn't there, click the green **\"New pull request\"** button.  \n4.Select your branches:  \n\n  - Base branch: This is the branch you want to merge into (e.g., main).\n  - Compare branch: This is your feature branch that contains the changes (e.g., `feature/contact-page`).  \n\nGitHub will show you a comparison of the changes between the two branches. Review them to ensure they're what you expect.  \n5. Create the Pull Request:  \n\n  - Provide a clear and concise title for your PR (e.g., \"Add Contact Us Page\").  \n  - Write a detailed description explaining what changes you made, why you made them, any potential issues, or how to test them. This is crucial for reviewers!  \n  \n  - You can also:  \n    - Assign reviewers: Choose team members who need to review your code.  \n    - Link issues: Connect your PR to any relevant GitHub issues.  \n    - Add labels: Categorize your PR (e.g., feature, bug).  \n\nClick the green **\"Create pull request\"** button.  \n\n6. Reviewing and Merging a Pull Request  \n\nOnce a Pull Request is created, the collaborative process begins!  \n\n**As a Reviewer:**\n\n- Review Changes: Look at the \"Files changed\" tab to see the code modifications.\n- Leave Comments: You can click on specific lines of code to add comments, ask questions, or suggest alternative solutions.\n- Approve/Request Changes: Once you've reviewed, you can either **\"Approve\"** the PR, **\"Request changes\"** (if modifications are needed), or simply **\"Comment\"** without a formal decision.\n\n**As the Author (or team lead):**\n\n- Address Feedback: Respond to comments and make any necessary changes to your code. If you make new commits on your feature branch locally and `git push origin feature/contact-page`, those new commits will automatically appear in your open Pull Request on GitHub.\n- Merge the Pull Request: Once all feedback is addressed, required checks pass, and the PR is approved, anyone with merge permissions can click the **\"Merge pull request\"** button on GitHub.\n  - GitHub offers different merge strategies:\n    - **Merge commit:** Creates a new commit that records the merge.\n    - **Squash and merge:** Combines all your feature branch commits into a single new commit on `main`. Great for keeping main's history clean.\n    - **Rebase and merge:** Reapplies your feature branch commits on top of main, creating a linear history.\n\n7. Deleting the Feature Branch (Optional but Recommended)\n\n  After your feature branch has been successfully merged into `main` and pushed to GitHub, you typically don't need the feature branch anymore. Deleting it keeps your repository tidy.\n\n  1. Delete the branch on GitHub:\nAfter merging a PR, GitHub usually gives you an option to \"Delete branch.\" Click that.\n\n  2. Delete the branch locally:\nFirst, ensure you're not on the branch you want to delete. Switch back to `main`:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ngit checkout main\n```\n:::\n\n  Then, delete the local branch:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ngit branch -d feature/contact-page\n```\n:::\n\nWe are all set to be a full stack developer!  \n\n",
