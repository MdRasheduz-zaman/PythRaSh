PythRaSh starts out as a step-by-step introduction to R, Python, Linux and Command-line Tools, Probability and Statistics, etc. while its later parts are more of a cookbook with analyses of typical examples in life sciences with focus on (Molecular) Biology, Breeding and Genetics, (Gen)-omics, Medical Sciences, Agriculture, Ecology and other related fields.

This website is currently under construction. I am trying to organize everything here. A huge appreciation to **Dr. Paul Schmidt** who motivated me in many ways, including the website designing. I just copy-pasted many things from him. [Check out his works here](https://schmidtpaul.github.io).

## Workshops

Moreover, the chapters published here serve as the basis for my YouTube teaching. Also, these are the primers for my upcoming workshops. Email me at **md.rasheduzzaman.ugoe\[at\]gmail.com** if you are interested in one of my upcoming workshops. Provide me with your details, what you want to learn, motivation behind that, what you are expert in, etc.

**I am teaching `Data Analysis with R` now.** Here, I teach R, basic git and GitHub, Linux and CLTs. These are the first step of taking you towards your (Gen)-omics journey.
